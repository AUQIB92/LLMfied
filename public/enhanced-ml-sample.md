## Module 1: Deep Learning Foundations

### Introduction to Neural Networks

Neural networks form the backbone of modern artificial intelligence and machine learning systems. Understanding their structure, function, and applications is crucial for anyone looking to work in AI, data science, or related fields.

**Mathematical Foundations:**
The basic neural network equation can be expressed as:
```
y = f(Σ(wi * xi) + b)
```
Where:
- y = output
- f = activation function
- wi = weights
- xi = inputs
- b = bias

### Backpropagation Algorithm

Backpropagation is the cornerstone algorithm that enables neural networks to learn from data by adjusting weights based on error gradients.

**Process Steps:**
1. Forward pass: Compute predictions
2. Calculate loss/error
3. Backward pass: Compute gradients
4. Update weights using optimization algorithm
5. Repeat until convergence

**Visual Representation:**
The algorithm can be visualized as a flow of information backward through the network, with each layer receiving error signals and updating its parameters accordingly.

**Code Example:**
```python
def backpropagation(network, input_data, target):
    # Forward pass
    output = forward_pass(network, input_data)
    
    # Calculate error
    error = calculate_loss(output, target)
    
    # Backward pass
    gradients = calculate_gradients(network, error)
    
    # Update weights
    update_weights(network, gradients)
    
    return error
```
